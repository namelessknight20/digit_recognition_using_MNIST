# digit_recognition_using_MNIST
Handwritten Digit Recognizer (PyTorch) A beginner-friendly Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. This project demonstrates the full machine learning pipeline: from data preprocessing and model architecture design to real-world testing with custom JPEG images.
